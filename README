Vector helper v0.1

This program has several helpful methods for working with vectors:
- calculate vector length: vec_length(vec)
- calculate the scalar product: scalar_prd(vec, vec)
- add two vectors together: vec_add(vec, vec)
- multiply a vector with an int: vec_mult(vec, int)
- subtract two vectors: vec_sub(vec, vec)
- calculate the angle between two vectors: calc_angle(vec, vec)

- calculate the orthogonal vector: vec_prod(vec, vec)
